# **Attendance Management System**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a simple **Attendance Management System** implemented in **C++**. It allows users to efficiently manage attendance records for students or employees by adding new entries, marking attendance, and viewing records. The system is designed for educational institutions, offices, or any organization that requires an attendance-tracking mechanism.  

## **Features**  
âœ… Add new students/employees to the system  
âœ… Mark attendance for a specific date  
âœ… View attendance records  
âœ… User-friendly interface with simple menu-driven functions
âœ… Data is stored persistently (if file handling is implemented)  

## **Requirements**  
ðŸ”¹ **C++ Compiler** (GCC, MinGW, MSVC)  
ðŸ”¹ Basic knowledge of C++ to modify or extend the system  

## **Installation & Usage**  

### **1. Compilation**  
Use the following command to compile the program:  
```bash
g++ Attendance_Management_System_C++.cpp -o attendance
```

### **2. Running the Program**  
After compilation, run the program with:

```

### **3. Using the System**  
- **1. Add Record** â†’ Enter new student/employee details  
- **2. Mark Attendance** â†’ Mark present/absent for a date  
- **3. View Records** â†’ Display saved attendance data  
- **4. Exit** â†’ Close the program  

## **Future Improvements**  
ðŸš€ Implement file handling for data persistence  
ðŸš€ Add a graphical user interface (GUI)  
ðŸš€ Integrate a database for better scalability
